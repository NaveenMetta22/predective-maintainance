# Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code for predictive maintenance using machine learning, focusing on predicting potential failures in machinery based on historical data and sensor information.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Keras**
- **Matplotlib**

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn keras matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries in your Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM, Activation
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.style.use('ggplot')  # Use 'ggplot' style for matplotlib plots
```

2. Continue with the rest of your script, loading data, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Data

Describe the data used for training and testing the predictive maintenance model. Include information on data sources, format, and any preprocessing steps.

## Model Training

Detail the steps involved in training the machine learning model. Include any hyperparameters, algorithms, and model evaluation metrics.

```bash
python train_model.py --data train_data.csv --model_params params.json
```

## Results

Share the results of the predictive maintenance model, including performance metrics, visualizations, and insights gained from the analysis.
